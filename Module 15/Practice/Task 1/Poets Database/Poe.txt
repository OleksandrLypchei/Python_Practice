Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 â€“ October 7, 1849) was an American writer, poet, editor, and
literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre.
He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and of American literature as a whole, and
he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. He is also generally considered the inventor of
the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. Poe was
the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life
and career.
Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth "Eliza" Poe.[3] His father abandoned the family
in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond,
Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as
Poe and John Allan repeatedly clashed over Poe's debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of Poe's
education. Poe attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money. He quarreled with Allan
over the funds for his education and enlisted in the United States Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this
time that his publishing career began with the anonymous collection Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to
"a Bostonian". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife in 1829. Poe later failed
as an officer cadet at West Point, declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and he ultimately parted ways with
Allan.
